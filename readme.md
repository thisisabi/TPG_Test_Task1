## Task 1

### In this task, use the reviews data and build a classification model for product category

### Most of scratch work and the bonus task work is in the notebook - tpg_test.ipynb

### I used simple CountVectorizer to create an embedding and then used it to with Naive Bayes classifier. I could have done GridSearch with a range of classifiers but my conditions didn't permit that.

### The notebook has my attempt at the bonus task. I used SVD as the resulting review matrix was pretty sparse. 

### If I had the time, I wanted to add code to expose the recommendation engine as a service using FastAPI. I have done that in a different project which I'm sharing access for. It was done for a friend so, am keeping it private.
